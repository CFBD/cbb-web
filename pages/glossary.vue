                    scoring margin and SOS. A team's
                    SRS rating is how much they would be expected to win (or lose) by to a perfectly average team. You
                    can calculate the expected score margin
                    between two teams by calculating the difference in their SRS ratings, after accounting for home
                    court advantage.</p>
